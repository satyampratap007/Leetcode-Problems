          // Let's analyze when an 'O' cannot be flipped,
          // if it has atleast one 'O' in it's adjacent, AND ultimately this chain of adjacent 'O's is connected to some 'O' which lies on boundary of board
            
          //consider these two cases for clarity :
          /*
            O's won't be flipped          O's will be flipped
            [X O X X X]                   [X X X X X]     
            [X O O O X]                   [X O O O X]
            [X O X X X]                   [X O X X X] 
            [X X X X X]                   [X X X X X]
          
          So we can conclude if a chain of adjacent O's is connected some O on boundary then they cannot be flipped

          //Steps to Solve :
          //1. Move over the boundary of board, and find O's 
          //2. Every time we find an O, perform DFS from it's position
          //3. In DFS convert all 'O' to '#'      (why?? so that we can differentiate which 'O' can be flipped and which cannot be)   
          //4. After all DFSs have been performed, board contains three elements,#,O and X
          //5. 'O' are left over elements which are not connected to any boundary O, so flip them to 'X'
          //6. '#' are elements which cannot be flipped to 'X', so flip them back to 'O'
          //7. finally, Upvote the solutionðŸ˜Š
